description="EditorPlugin PSUWatcher autoloads PSUManager as Singleton. When any resource (= Shader) is saved, Watcher sends message via EditorDebuggerPlugin's \"session\" system, which is received at runtime by Manager. Manager signals the Gatherers (added as Children to specific scene Nodes) - to receive their controlled Materials. Manager updates Materials matching the saved resource."
